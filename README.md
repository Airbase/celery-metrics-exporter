## Components

### CeleryEventReceiver
- this is component listening the celery events
    - runs as a separate thread
- any filters worker related events
- stores the events in the **Store** with task-id as key

### Exporter

- the plan is to support
    - Datadog stores â†’ will start this for initial version
    - Postgres stores
- the exporters will be started as different threads as well.

### Store

- this has a `event_store` with `task-id` as key and different events as value
- a `processing_queue` where task-id succeeded / failed task are pushed to be picked by the exporters
